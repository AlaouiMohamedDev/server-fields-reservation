This project is a football field reservation system that allows users to book a football field in their desired location. The system provides features like path tracing, geolocation, user authentication, booking process, and sport complex registration.

Features
Path Tracing
The system is capable of tracing the path that takes the user to their destination field. This can be done through geolocation, visual interactive maps, statistical algorithms, and machine learning algorithms.

User Authentication
The system provides identity verification for all visitors who want to book a field. Users can sign up for the system by providing their email address and password. If the user is not already registered, they can sign up for the system.

Booking Process
The system offers multiple options for users to create a reservation. They can create a reservation for 10 people, create a reservation for two different teams, or create a reservation with uncompleted players. The reservation will be valid when other users fill the missing places.

Sport Complex Registration
The system allows sport complex owners to register their complex by providing information such as price, location, pictures, and schedule.

Management
The system provides management of services, plans, and offers. It also manages user information and addresses, and offers a customer interface for field owners and players.

Centralized Management
The system offers centralized management for authentication and authorizations of users of different modules. Lists with geolocation can be imported via web service API or JSON files.
